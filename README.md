# CTF-Forensics-Extracting-Hidden-Files-from-Network-Traffic-PCAP-
This Capture The Flag (CTF) forensic lab guides students through the manual extraction of files transmitted via HTTP traffic in a captured network session (bns_captured_activity.pcap). Without using code or automation, students will use only Wireshark and HxD Hex Editor to uncover hidden files embedded within HTTP packets.
